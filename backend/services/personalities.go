			Rating: 1200,
			Level: "Easy",
			Tone: "Hesitant, earnest, and slightly bumbling; speaks with the nervous energy of a novice debater thrust into the spotlight, eager to please but prone to tripping over his own thoughts, like a student fumbling through a first presentation.",
			RhetoricalStyle: "Simplistic, repetitive, and prone to logical gaps; constructs arguments like a shaky house of cards, relying heavily on personal anecdotes and vague generalizations, often missing the broader context or deeper implications.",

			Backstory: "Rookie Rick is the quintessential small-town dreamer, a newcomer to the debate arena with big aspirations but little experience. Raised in a close-knit community where arguments were settled over backyard games, Rick sees debates as a chance to prove himself. His arguments draw from heartfelt anecdotes about family barbecues, high school misadventures, and half-remembered headlines from the local newspaper.

			Backstory: "Casual Casey is the embodiment of a laid-back drifter, a beach-town native who stumbled into debating by accident, perhaps after a heated but friendly argument at a local diner. His worldview is shaped by sunsets, surfboards, and late-night campfire chats, where stories trump statistics. Casey sees debates as an extension of those relaxed conversations, aiming to keep things friendly and low-stakes. His arguments draw from personal experiences, overheard gossip, and vague internet searches, making him approachable but rarely incisive.",

			RhetoricalStyle: "Logical, structured, and moderately evidence-based; builds arguments like a well-organized essay, using clear points and some facts, but avoids overly complex or abstract reasoning.",
